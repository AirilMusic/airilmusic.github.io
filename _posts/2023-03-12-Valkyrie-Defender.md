# INTRODUCTION

This is a bot to automate and improve discord servers security. The bot has a lot of functions, punishment system, detection spam, malicious links and files, NSFW content, adminstration commands... And with a configuration that can be adapted to each server individually.

Also, the different servers share a blacklist of banned users, which allows you to know if a new user has been banned in another Discord and why. And if you want, you can automate the banning of blacklisted users from the configuration, all through simple commands that automate everything possible.

It reports all incidents to users with the 'valkyrie_admin' role and most of the time in the 'valkyrie' administration channel.

Invite the bot to your Discord server:
