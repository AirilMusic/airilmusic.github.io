## INTRODUCTION

My goal with this tool is to simplify and automate the processes of enumeration, attacks, and other cybersecurity tasks, making them accessible and user-friendly for both seasoned professionals and novices alike. Designed to evolve gradually, this project is a long-term endeavor, and I appreciate your patience and understanding for any initial shortcomings or errors.

For enhanced accessibility, the tool supports both Linux and Windows platforms, although certain features might be Linux-exclusive. This dual-platform compatibility ensures the tool's utility in a wide range of educational settings, from teaching basic pentesting and vulnerability assessment in computer science classes to demonstrating the critical importance of cybersecurity and risk management.

All designed with an intuitive user interface that streamlines complex tasks. 

**I do not take responsibility for the misuse that may be made of this tool.**
