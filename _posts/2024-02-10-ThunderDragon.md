## INTRODUCTION


My intention with this tool is to automate enumeration, attacks, and various other tasks in a simple, comfortable, and quick way, so that both experts and people who are starting out can use it easily and comfortably. The idea is to develop it little by little, and it's a project that will take many years to complete, so I apologize if there are missing features or errors.
