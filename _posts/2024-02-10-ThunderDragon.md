## INTRODUCTION

My intention with this tool is to automate enumeration, attacks, and various other tasks in a simple, comfortable, and quick way, so that both experts and people who are starting out can use it easily and comfortably. The idea is to develop it little by little, and it's a project that will take many years to complete, so I apologize if there are missing features or errors.

For greater accessibility, this tool is made to work on both Linux and Windows, although there might be some features that only work on Linux. This way, it can also be easily used to teach basic pentesting, vulnerabilities, and other practical skills in computer science classes, thus demonstrating the fundamental importance of cybersecurity and risk management. Additionally, it serves to quickly check things from Windows environments.

**I do not take responsibility for the misuse that may be made of this tool.**
